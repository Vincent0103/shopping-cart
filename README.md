# Shopping Cart


## Description

This project is part of the TOP curriculum, a project made to enhance my knowledge of react testing, class components and advanced concepts of the react ecosystem.

It showcases a typical shopping cart application where you are presented with a homepage with it's categories and sub-sections. Once you reach the shop tab, you can buy products based on certain categories (electronics, clothings...). You then choose the amount of the product you'd like to order then a cart popup will appear. Clicking the checkout link will head you to the checkout page where you can have a general overview of your current cart and the products informations.

The website has been mainly focused on web design since i want to deeply improve my designing skills and i did so with figma. I can safely say that i'm pretty good at web designing now.

The hardest part for me and to stay motivated was the implementation of react tests. It was such a struggle to work with since there are a lot of functionnalities to test with. So i covered the codebase with about 60% of it which is not bad but was enough to make me feel comfortable with testing the DOM. I pretty much enjoyed this project when working with routers but it's also one of my longest web project ever (4 months of building, well more like 2 months since school started).
